NEED TO DO:
5. Integration Testing
6. Selenium Testing





ALREADY FINISHED:
1. Change the Filter, this one isn't really working like it should!
2. Edit and Add forms both make problems.
- This is caused inside of the BalloonController Class, in the "/add" method!
- I'll need to add the Balloon ID and search based on that, in the BalloonServiceImpl!
3. Registration of new members needed.
4. Junit Testing
